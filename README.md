# Cards against humanity on discord

I've made a discord bot that randomly sends you one of the 114 black cards from Cards against humanity.

## Preparation

1. Create a webhook on your server
2. Create a channel named 'cards-against-humanity' on your server
3. Invite my bot on your server through an [invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=950451778237923439&permissions=534723951680&scope=bot)
4. All players need to run discord_cah_messaging.exe or discord_cah_messaging.py (when using the python script, you need to install 'discord' library)
5. In the popup that appears after you run discord_cah_messaging, you need to input the webhook link
6. After that, you should be set

## Game

The rules should be the same as in the card version, with a few exceptions:

1. There doesn't have to be a person reading the cards and picking the best answer (white card), you can do it collectively
2. You don't have to use given white cards (also, you can't), you can, for example, use memes
